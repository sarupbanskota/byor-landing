          Torvalds wanted a BitKeeper-like distributed system for the kernel, 
          but none of the available systems met his needs.
          <br/><br/>
        </p>
        <p>
          He cited an example of a SCM system needing 30s to apply a patch 
          and update all associated metadata, and noted that this would 
          not scale to the needs of Linux kernel development, where 
          synchronizing with fellow maintainers could
          require 250 such actions at once. 
          
          <br/><br/> For his design criterion, he
          specified patching should take no more than three seconds, and
          added three more goals:
          <br/><br/>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-8 ">
            <li>Take Concurrent Versions System (CVS) as an example of what not to do; if in doubt, do the exact opposite</li>
            <li>Support a distributed, BitKeeper-like workflow</li>
            <li>Include very strong safeguards against corruption, either accidental or malicious</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

    </main>
